    This approach uses two additional arrays that compute the product before and after each index then combine those products.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nums : list of int
        A list of integers.

    Returns
    -------
    list of int
        A list of integers that are products of all elements in the array except that at its index.

    Examples
    -------
    >>> f([1,2,3,4])
